- 👋 Hi, I’m @upsiflu. Call me Flupsi.
- 👀 I’m interested in:
   - how user interfaces feel in the body, especially as a spatial experience
   - how these virtual-but-physical spaces are shared among people
   - how creative ways of dwelling in these spaces emerge
   - Dance
   - Decentering instead of Inclusion
   - Self-organisation and minimizing 'protocol'.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning
   - Portuguese
   - Category theory (this seems to become a lifelong project)
   - Curating
   - Overcoming anxieties and helping others overcome theirs
   - Posthumanist and Cyberfeminist theory
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
   - All sorts of Elm projects (I love Elm for its simplicity, transparency, expressivity)
   - Applying posthumanist and cyberfeminist insights into a paradigm shift, away from subject-object relation and towards the affirmation of embodiment and glitchiness
