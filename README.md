- 👋 Hi, I’m @upsiflu. Call me Flupsi.
- 👀 I’m interested in:
   - [Conversations about Shells](ShellCongress.com)
   - Dance
   - Self-organisation and minimizing 'protocol'
- ✨ Sparks all over the place:
   - Gui patterns that are not harmful
   - Decentering instead of Inclusion
- 🌱 I’m currently learning
   - Category theory (this seems to become a lifelong project)
   - [Curating](https://youngcuratorsacademy.com/event/super-intense-marathon/day-1/proposing-the-figure-of-the-shell-for-the-materiality-of-image-carrying-surfaces-t66gybhn)
   - Overcoming anxieties and helping others overcome theirs
   - [Cyberfeminist theory](https://www.are.na/flupsi-upsi/shell-3fezyrjc5iy)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
   - All sorts of Elm projects (I like Elm because it's restrained but expressive)
   - Applying posthumanist and cyberfeminist insights into a paradigm shift, away from subject-object relation and towards the affirmation of embodiment and glitchiness
   - application of p2p, CRDTs, for collaboration
